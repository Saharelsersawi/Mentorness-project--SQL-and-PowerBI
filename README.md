# Mentorness Project
These are two projects I did with Mentorness. The first project is Hotel Reservation Data Analysis which was done using MySQL. The second project is Video Songs Data Analysis which was done with MS PowerBI.
## Git LFS
I saved the PowerBI document using Git LFS as it was too large to store. Below are instructions on how to install Git LFS to view my file:
```
git lfs install
```
